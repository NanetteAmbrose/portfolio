                                    I was assigned to write an obituary in the event of an important person’s death. I chose Mark Zuckerberg. I researched his life and found then-current information that made for a poignant story. I did my best to craft a picture of an industry tycoon, while still remembering his humanity.  
                                </p>

                                   A mock press release I made for a class. We were given a set of facts about an event and then told to make a newsworthy press release. I made a point to be honest while still representing the fictional company. I kept in the vital information, while still painting the company in the best light.

                                    A speech I wrote on the representation of women in media, specifically in video games. The goal was to make a well-researched speech that convinced the audience. I have always cared deeply about representation, especially in my favorite forms of media, so women in video games was an obvious choice for this project.

                                   In collaboration with a group I created a public relations plan for one of the clubs or organizations that operated on the campus of the University of Saint Francis. One of my major roles was helping to work out the strategies and tactics used in our mission. I was unable to put the whole plan here, but I was able to add in our basic plan: our goal, objectives, strategies and tactics.

                                    Done my freshmen year, as part of a group, I helped created a full business plan for a fictional company. My role was to create the marketing plan for this buisness. This business would sell fresh locally grown throughout the year, but more specifically in winter. This would be accomplished by growing the food in greenhouses. For promoting our product, I decided that cultivating an image of a local business concerned about the customer would be the best marketing strategy.

                                <p>
                                    The main tools we would use for promotion was word of mouth, using local fairs and farmer’s markets and other local events. We planned to become involved and well known in and around Fort Wayne Indiana. Beyond we plan to use a pulsing schedule to advertise on local radio, newspapers, and targeted Facebook ads.

                                <p>I have been writing since I was nine. Story telling is my passion. While none of my work has been published, I have long-term goals of finishing the novel I am currently working on, and trying to get it published.</p>

                                   An unused scene from the novel I am currently working on. It is one of my favorites. Meant to be the starting scene, this section shows my main character’s father wishing for better things for himself and his daughter.

                                    I made this with Adobe InDesign and Photoshop; I was assigned to make a four-fold brochure as class work. For this design I wanted to make something warm that would make people think of home, yet also distinguished enough to give the feeling of high-end furniture. I went with an earthy brown and leaf design because their natural tones worked well with the color palette of the photos I had to work with, while also capturing the feeling I was looking for.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    The brochure is meant to be folded inward at the center with the topside facing outward. The ends are meant to be folded in so when the brochure is first opened they form one picture. The inner side, seen on the bottom of the pdf, is meant to opened and viewed as one page.

                                    These logos were created in a class working with the Adobe Suite, specifically Adobe Illustrator. Graphic design is not my specialty, but I do understand how to use the Adobe Suite. This project was a pleasure to make.

                                    This self-portrait was created in a class working with the Adobe Suite. My goal was to not only capture my face with vector art, but also to serve as a form of self expression.

                                    In the fall of my sophomore year for a speech class we were assigned to record a podcast with the help of music tech students. For this assignment, I conducted an interview of one of the cast members of a university play. I worked to coordinate with her and the music tech students to arrange the meeting time. The music tech students worked the recording equipment and edited the final project. I picked the topic, worked to arrange the interview, and picked the questions asked.
